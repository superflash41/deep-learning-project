\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Wildfires pose a serious threat to the environment and public health.
Their frequency has increased due to climate change and growing human activity in forested areas \cite{Bot2022}.
Wildfires can be triggered naturally or by human negligence, causing severe damage to
infrastructure, biodiversity, and the economy.

The early detection of wildfires is crucial to enable a faster response from firefighting crews.
Traditional sensor-based or satellite-based methods often face limitations in coverage or timeliness.

Deep learning has proven highly effective in image analysis, especially for fire or smoke
detection, surpassing many traditional approaches.
In this work, we propose a \textbf{deep learning model} capable of \textbf{real-time wildfire detection} from
drone-captured images, aiming for faster and more efficient identification of active fires.
