Key observations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Individual vs. Ensemble:} 
      DenseNet outperforms the ensemble in pure accuracy (86.50\%). Xception had the
      lowest F1-score but still gained from hyperparameter tuning.
    \item \textbf{Class Imbalance:} 
      Weighted loss and data augmentation helped mitigate the Fire vs. No Fire imbalance.
      However, some confusion persists in subtle smoke conditions.
    \item \textbf{Comparison to FireSight:} 
      Our DenseNet surpasses their best accuracy (86.50\% vs. 82.28\%), but the ensemble’s
      F1-score (0.7169) is lower than FireSight’s 0.75.
    \item \textbf{Dataset Limitations:} 
      FLAME does not cover every forest environment (e.g., tropical rainforests), so
      further dataset expansion could generalize these models better.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, advanced fine-tuning and hyperparameter search (via Keras Tuner) were crucial
to reaching these performance levels.
