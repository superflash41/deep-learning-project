\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DenseNet121} achieved the best accuracy (86.50\%) on FLAME, with an
    F1-score of 0.8324.
    \item The \textbf{ensemble} of Xception, DenseNet, and ResNet delivers consistent
    performance (79.40\% accuracy), though it does not surpass DenseNet alone.
    \item \textbf{Keras Tuner} guided hyperparameter tuning, significantly improving
    each individual model's performance.
    \item \textbf{Future Directions:}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Knowledge Distillation:} Compress the ensemble into MobileNetV3
        for lighter deployments on drones.
        \item \textbf{Pruning:} Reduce unnecessary weights to speed up inference.
        \item \textbf{Vision Transformers (ViTs):} Integrate and compare them against
        the CNN ensemble.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

In summary, this project underscores the potential of deep learning for near-real-time
wildfire detection and opens the path for efficient aerial monitoring systems.
