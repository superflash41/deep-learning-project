\section{Data Preprocessing}
\label{sec:data-preprocessing}

In this section, we describe our approach to preparing the FLAME dataset before training.
Since the dataset is already structured for the wildfire classification task, \textbf{no data augmentation was applied}.
We focused on analyzing the dataset distribution and ensuring the images were properly formatted for training.

\subsection{Data Distribution}
\label{subsec:data-distribution}

We examined the distribution of images across the two categories: \textit{Fire} and \textit{No\_Fire}.
The \textbf{training set} contains \textbf{63.55\% Fire} images (25,027) and \textbf{36.45\% No\_Fire} images (14,357).
The \textbf{test set} consists of \textbf{3,480 Fire} images and \textbf{5,137 No\_Fire} images.

All images were resized to \textbf{224\(\times\)224} pixels to maintain consistency across model inputs.
Additionally, pixel values were normalized to the \textbf{[0,1]} range before being fed into the model.
