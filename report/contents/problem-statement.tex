\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem-statement}

Although deep learning has led to remarkable progress in wildfire detection, many existing
architectures remain too large or computationally expensive to deploy on a drone.
This limits their practicality in real-time aerial monitoring.

Additionally, although there exist optimized models for devices with limited computational
capabilities, many have not been updated with the latest detection architectures, possibly
affecting both accuracy and speed.

Hence, our objective is to explore models that strike a balance between precision and
efficiency, enabling effective deployment on drones for early wildfire detection.
