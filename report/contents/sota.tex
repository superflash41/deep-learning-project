\subsection{Classic Methods and Sensors}
\label{subsec:classic-methods}

Earlier methods use various sensors (optical, smoke, gas, temperature), but they only
detect partial indicators of fire and have limited coverage.
Classical image processing often relies on color segmentation of flames or smoke,
but may yield high false positives (e.g., bright lights, cloud glare).

\subsection{Machine Learning and Deep Learning}
\label{subsec:ml-dl}

Computer vision has evolved to use shape, texture, and light variation for detecting
fire or smoke, extending beyond simple color segmentation.

\subsubsection{CNNs for Classification}
Architectures like Inception, Xception, DenseNet, or ResNet have shown promise in
binary fire classification.
Key techniques include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transfer Learning:} Reusing networks pretrained on large datasets, then
    fine-tuning them for fire detection.
    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation:} Generating new images from existing ones to increase
    dataset size and variability.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Object Detection with YOLO}
Unlike CNNs that classify an entire image, YOLO (You Only Look Once) localizes
the region containing fire or smoke.
YOLOv8 simplifies anchor settings and has proven
efficient for real-time detection \cite{yaseen2024yolov8indepthexplorationinternal}.

\subsubsection{Vision Transformers (ViTs)}
ViTs capture global relationships in images through self-attention.
Although they require large amounts of data, pretraining on extensive datasets can yield excellent
performance for fire detection.

\subsection{Recent Highlights}
\label{subsec:recent-highlights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chetoui \& Akhloufi (2024):} Fine-tuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv7 on a set of
    11k images. YOLOv8 outperformed YOLOv7 in smoke/fire detection.
    \item \textbf{MobileViT (Mehta \& Rastegari, 2022):} Proposed a lightweight transformer,
    combining convolution and global self-attention for mobile devices.
    \item \textbf{FireSight (Palaparthi \& Nangi, 2023):} Combined ViTs and CNNs in an ensemble,
    achieving 82.28\% accuracy on the FLAME dataset \cite{firesight2023}.
\end{itemize}
